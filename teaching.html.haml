    %h3 Teaching Philosophy

    As a teacher, my goal is to develop creative, independent problem-solvers
    who are curious about the natural world. My students learn the process of
    science, as well as specific knowledge. They practice critical thinking
    skills that will be valuable both within and beyond the classroom.  To help
    my students reach these goals, I create an interactive classroom that
    encourages questions, promotes discussions and stimulates debates. I aim to
    provide a challenging but supportive environment where students can learn
    from each other as well as from me.
