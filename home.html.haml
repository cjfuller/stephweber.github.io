%h2.pagetitle Spatial Organization of Living Systems

Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are crowded with macromolecules that form highly organized yet dynamic structures.  While advances in fluorescence microscopy enable us to visualize this spatiotemporal heterogeneity, the physical mechanisms underlying intracellular organization remain unknown.  I am interested in understanding how biological systems establish and dynamically regulate spatial order in the cell and how these processes affect growth and size of the whole organism.
